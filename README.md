# Walmart_AdvancedAnalysis
Problem:
There are many seasons that sales are significantly higher or lower than averages. If the company does not know about these seasons, it can lose too much money. Predicting future sales is one of the most crucial plans for a company. Sales forecasting gives an idea to the company for arranging stocks, calculating revenue, and deciding to make a new investment. Another advantage of knowing future sales is that achieving predetermined targets from the beginning of the seasons can have a positive effect on stock prices and investors' perceptions. Also, not reaching the projected target could significantly damage stock prices, conversely. And, it will be a big problem especially for Walmart as a big company.

Aim:
My aim in this project is to build a model which predicts sales of the stores. With this model, Walmart authorities can decide their future plans which is very important for arranging stocks, calculating revenue and deciding to make new investment or not


Future Improvements:
Data will be made more stationary with different techniques.
More detailed feature engineering and feature selection will be done.
More data can be found to observe holiday effects on sales and different holidays will be added like Easter, Halloween and Come Back to School times.
Markdown effects on model will be improved according to department sales.
Different models can be build for special stores or departments.
Market basket analysis can be done to find higher demand items of departments.
